This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Daiku Interior & Eksterior Pekanbaru** - A professional static website prototype for an interior and exterior design company, designed to support a comprehensive final project (Proyek Akhir) with 17+ key features. This system demonstrates a complete digital transformation solution for traditional interior design businesses, ready for Laravel framework implementation.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup with modern standards
- **CSS3**: Custom framework with Flexbox/Grid layouts
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No external dependencies for core functionality
- **Font Awesome 6.4.0**: Icons via CDN
- **Local Storage**: For demo data persistence and user sessions

## Key Features Implemented

### Public Pages (1-5)
1. **Landing Page** - Hero section, featured designs, services, testimonials, stats
2. **Catalog Page** - Portfolio grid with advanced filters, search, sorting, pagination
3. **Design Detail Page** - Image gallery, specifications, pricing, related designs
4. **Auth Page** - Login/register forms with role selection and demo quick-login
5. **RFQ Form** - 4-step consultation form with file upload and form validation

### Dashboard Pages (6)
6. **Customer Dashboard** - Project tracking, order history, stats, notifications, messages

### Core Components Built
- Responsive navigation with mobile menu
- Modal system for lightboxes and dialogs
- Toast notification system
- Form validation and multi-step forms
- File upload with drag & drop
- Image gallery with lightbox
- Progress bars and status badges
- Data tables with sorting and filtering
- Local storage management for demo data

## Demo Data Structure

The application includes comprehensive demo data:
- **Design Portfolio**: 6+ interior designs with full specifications
- **Customer Orders**: Sample orders with different statuses and progress
- **User Accounts**: Demo customers, admin, and designer accounts
- **Chat Messages**: Sample conversations between users
- **Notifications**: System notifications for different user types
- **Payment Records**: Sample payment history and status

## Authentication System

Role-based authentication with three user types:
- **Customer**: Access to catalog, ordering, project tracking
- **Admin**: Full system management (to be implemented)
- **Designer**: Project management and customer communication (to be implemented)

Quick login options available for demo purposes.

## Responsive Design

Mobile-first approach with breakpoints:
- **Mobile**: 320px - 768px (single column, stacked navigation)
- **Tablet**: 768px - 1024px (2-column grids, condensed layouts)  
- **Desktop**: 1024px+ (multi-column grids, full features)

## Color Scheme

- **Primary**: #2c3e50 (dark blue-gray)
- **Secondary**: #3498db (blue)
- **Accent**: #e74c3c (red for CTAs)
- **Success**: #27ae60 (green)
- **Warning**: #f39c12 (orange)
- **Neutral**: #f8f9fa, #ffffff, #666666

## Browser Support

Modern browsers supporting:
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- ES6+ JavaScript features
- Local Storage API
- Fetch API (simulated with setTimeout)

## Development Notes

- No build process required - pure static files
- All external dependencies loaded via CDN
- Demo data initialized automatically on first load
- Form drafts saved to localStorage
- Fully functional without backend API

## Future Expansion

The codebase is structured for easy conversion to dynamic backend:
- Clear separation of data layer (js/data.js)
- RESTful URL patterns ready for API integration
- Form structures match typical backend requirements
- Authentication flow prepared for real user management

## Testing

Test the application by:
1. Open `index.html` in browser
2. Use quick login buttons in auth.html for different user roles
3. Test responsive design across device sizes
4. Verify form submissions and data persistence
5. Test all interactive components (modals, dropdowns, etc.)
